# Getting Started with Adobe I/O

Adobe I/O is the place for developers looking to integrate, extend, or create apps and experiences based on Adobe's products and technologies.

Whether you are looking to build on top on Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, or Marketing Cloud, Adobe I/O has all the resources you need to create next-generation experiences that connect you to your customers.

Right now, our focus at Adobe I/O is to provide a single source for developer-focused product documentation, up-to-date information about the Adobe Cloud Platform and access to the Adobe I/O Console, which allows you to register API keys, connect applications to Adobe cloud services and inspect log and debug messages.
